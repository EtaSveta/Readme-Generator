  ## Description
  Every good project needs a quality README with information about the app - what kind of the app it is, what is it for, how to use it, how to install it,  and how to make contributions so that other developers are more likely to use and contribute to the success of the project.

This is a command-line application that runs with Node.js that dynamically generates a README.md file based user answers about the project. Check out the profREADME.md in this repo as an example.

  ## Installation
  Here is how to install and set up the README generator:

Clone the repo: git clone git@github.com:EtaSveta/Readme-Generator.git

Install NPM package: npm install inquirer@8.2.4
  
  ## Usage
  When user runs node index.js, the application uses the inquirer package to prompt user in the command line with a series of questions about their GitHub project and contact information. Then profREADME.md is generated based on the answers.
